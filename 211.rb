# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

#Create an array to store 5 numbers. Then print out each number on separate lines with a while loop.

index = 0
numbers = [3,6,8,4,7]
while index < numbers.length
    puts numbers[index]
    index=index+1
end


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

#I messed up the syntax for creating an array, so thats tommorrows practice goal
#I put numbers [3,6,8,4,7], instead of numbers = [3,6,8,4,7]
